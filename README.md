Fun one day project I coded because I was bored and co worker asked to listen to my liked songs, but couldn't.

Using requests and Spotify's web API.

Documentation for creating an APP on Spotify's developer platform and obtaining CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/).
